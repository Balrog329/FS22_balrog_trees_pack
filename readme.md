Welcome to the repository of one of my mods.
As a professional forester and a passionate Farming Simulator 22 player, I’ve always wanted to bring into the game the wide variety of tree species I encounter in my daily work. This mod is first and foremost a personal project, created to enrich the forest environment with more realistic and diverse species.
The i3d tree models come from several different maps, and include:

- European silver fir (Abies alba) — based on the spruce models from the Karhuvaara map by INF Modding.
- Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) — taken from Silverrun Forest by GIANTS Software.
- Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) — also sourced from Silverrun Forest by GIANTS Software.
- Norway spruce (Picea abies) — extracted from the Deer Lands map by Carl‑TG and PixelFarm’s.
- European aspen (Populus tremula) — from the Karhuvaara map by INF Modding.
- Dead trees — also originating from Silverrun Forest.
- New birch model — adapted from the birches found in Karhuvaara.


Most species can be purchased in pallets of 316 seedlings from the shop and placed through the construction menu.
Their size, shape, and growth speed vary depending on the species to better reflect realistic forest dynamics.


Enjoy the game and happy forestry!
